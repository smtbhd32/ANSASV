# ANSASV
ANSASV is an open-source, modular ROS2-based framework for autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) navigation, supporting waypoint-based navigation, dynamic obstacle avoidance, waterbody awareness, and modular mission planning. This project is designed to enable autonomous marine applications like patrolling, ocean/lake cleaning.
